## <span style="color:#469586;font-weight:600;font-size:30px"> What is Machine Learning?</span>
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on input data.

Essentially, machine learning algorithms are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns, without being explicitly programmed to do so. The algorithms are trained on a large dataset, and as they receive more data, they improve their accuracy and decision-making capabilities.

This is achieved through the use of statistical and mathematical techniques that enable the system to identify patterns and relationships within the data, and then use this knowledge to make predictions or decisions about new data.

There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each of which has its own unique approach to learning from data.

### <span style="color:#469586;font-weight:500;font-size:20px"> Foundations of Machine Learning </span>
Machine learning is a field of computer science that involves the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and improve their performance based on experience or data. The foundations of machine learning are rooted in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Some of the key foundational concepts of machine learning include:

* <span font-weight:500;font-size:20px"> Linear algebra:  </span>
Linear algebra is used to represent and manipulate data in the form of vectors and matrices. It is used extensively in machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, and clustering.

* <span font-weight:500;font-size:20px"> Statistics:  </span>
Statistics is used to analyze and interpret data in machine learning algorithms. It is used to measure the accuracy of predictions, to identify patterns in data, and to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.


* <span font-weight:500;font-size:20px"> Probability theory:  </span>
Probability theory is used to model uncertainty in machine learning algorithms. It is used to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes and to make predictions based on statistical inference.

* <span font-weight:500;font-size:20px"> Optimization theory:  </span>
Optimization is used to optimize machine learning algorithms by minimizing a loss function that measures the error between the predicted output and the actual output. Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning.
