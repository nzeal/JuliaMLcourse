# Unsupervised Learning

**Objective**

- Understanding the concept of unsupervised learning
- Using different clustering techniques in JuliaLang

## Overview

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on unclassified or unlabeled data. This means that the data used for training does not have any target variable or labels. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns or structure in the data without any prior knowledge of the correct output or target variable

There are different types of unsupervised learning algorithms that can be implemented including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.

Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised learning to group similar data points together. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns and structures in the data that can be used for further analysis or to make predictions.

Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in unsupervised learning to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. JuliaLang has several packages that can be used for dimensionality reduction, including MultivariateStats.jl and PCA.jl. These packages implement various dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

Unsupervised learning is a powerful technique for identifying patterns and relationships in input data without the need for labeled data. By understanding the basics of unsupervised learning and the different types of unsupervised learning algorithms, we can apply these techniques to real-world problems and develop more accurate and reliable models.
